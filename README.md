# Multi-Step-Deformable-Registration

This is a PyTorch implementation of the following paper:
'Unsupervised Multi-Step Deformable Registration ofRemote Sensing Imagery based on Deep Learning'

# To use this code:
Run 'python train.py' to train the model.  <br/> <br/>
Run 'show.py' to make registration predictions on the test set.

# Version of employed packages:
- pytorch 1.5.1
- python 3.6.10
- matplotlib 3.2.2

# Outputs:
Examples of the output of the show.py script (result after few training epochs):
